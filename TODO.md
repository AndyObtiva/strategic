# TODO

- Set strategy_name when setting strategy attribute (to store strategy_name column in Rails)
- Support generating strategy_name migration
- Customize strategy_name attribute name (e.g. sort_strategy_name)
- Support multiple strategies (with multiple strategy name attributes/columns)
- Configuration option of `rails_auto_mixin_modules` in Rails to indicate whether to include module mixins automatically by convention for Strategic and Strategic::Strategy
